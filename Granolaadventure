<h1> Granola Recipe</h1> 

<p> This is how I made the granola!</p> 

<h2> Ingrediants</h2> 

<p>
<ul>2 cups rolled oats<br> 
1 cup chopped Almonds<br> 
1 cup Millet<br>
1 cup Flax Seed<br>
1 cup chopped cranberries<br>
1 cup coconut flakes<br>
</p>
<p> Mix oats, almonds, millet, flax, chopped cranberries, coconut flakes and spices into a large bowl dry</p> 
<p> Heat vanilla, salt and rice syrup in a pan until it is easy to stir and pour (like melting honey to make it easier to pour).</p> 
<p> Pour rice syrup mixture over dry mix slowing, stirring the mix as you go (see video)</p> 
<p> spread out a thin layer on a baking sheet and put in the oven for 40 minutes. Turn the baking sheet at 20minutes so it gets cooked evenly.</p> 

<p> Once your granola is crispy, or as cooked as youâ€™d like, take it out of the oven, let it cool for 5-10 minutes and enjoy it!</p>
